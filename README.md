## 🧠 Overview

**Engineering-Team** is an advanced **Agentic AI engineering pipeline** designed by **Rahul Sharma**, built on top of the crewAI framework.  
It simulates a complete software engineering workflow by orchestrating multiple specialized AI agents — each with its own role, responsibilities, and expertise.

This system behaves like a fully staffed engineering department where AI agents collaborate end-to-end to produce real, production-ready software. The pipeline includes:

### 🔹 **Engineering Lead (Architecture & Design Agent)**  
Responsible for converting high-level requirements into complete system designs.  
This agent produces:
- Backend architecture  
- Class & method signatures  
- One-module design specs  
- Clear, testable requirements  

### 🔹 **Backend Engineer (Python Implementation Agent)**  
Implements the design produced by the Engineering Lead.  
This agent generates:
- Clean, modular, self-contained Python modules  
- Fully functional class implementations  
- Ready-to-test backend logic  

### 🔹 **Frontend Engineer (Gradio UI Agent)**  
Builds interactive UI interfaces for the backend logic.  
This agent produces:
- A complete `app.py` Gradio interface  
- A UI demonstrating the backend module  
- A user-ready local application  

### 🔹 **Test Engineer (QA / Unit Test Agent)**  
Ensures reliability through automated test generation.  
This agent produces:
- Unit test files  
- `test_<module_name>.py` modules  
- Coverage of key backend behaviors  

---

Together, these agents form a **true Agentic AI system** capable of:

- Turning human requirements into detailed engineering specs  
- Converting specs into backend code  
- Auto-generating front-end UI  
- Producing complete unit tests  
- Creating a fully working software module in one automated pipeline
